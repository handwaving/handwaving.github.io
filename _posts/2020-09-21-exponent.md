![Spending a ton of time searching for an explanation of an equation, only to realize that the exponent is a footnote.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/Exponent.png){: .centre-image }

This is absolutely based on a true story, and it makes me aware of every single footnote I write. I spent *so* much time trying to figure out how in the world the author arrived at the equation!
