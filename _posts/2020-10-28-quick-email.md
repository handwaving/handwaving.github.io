![Emailing a professor seems like it could take just a minute, but in reality takes several hours.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{ post.imagelink }.png){: .centre-image }

The time professors spend reading your email is inversely proportional to the time you spend writing it.

(It seems like I was subconsciously inspired by [this comic from Jorge Cham](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1047), so I wanted to link to his work. He was inspired by someone else for that comic too, so I guess there's a multi-comic thread going through this idea now!)
