![Trying to understand a paper often includes reading a ton of other papers. This is academia's version of "batteries not included".](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

The best part is that the papers that really help me understand aren't often the cited ones.

Oh, who am I kidding? It's usually the [Physics](physics.stackexchange.com/) or [Quantum Computing](quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/) StackExchange which give me the answers I need.
