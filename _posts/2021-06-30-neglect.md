![How does an airplane fly? A young kid says it's because the engines are big and powerful. An engineer says it's because lift is generated by the shape of the plane. And the physics undergrad is puzzled, because they have been taught to always ignore air friction.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

For all the grief we physics students give engineers, I'd take something designed by an engineer over a physicist most days! (Particularly if they are a theoretical physicist...)
