In the far future, a supervisor sits down with their graduate student on their first meeting.

Supervisor: "You're about to embark on an incredible journey. You will read lots of papers, and now these warnings are attached to nearly all of them."

Student: "Will I ever see one without a warning?"

Supervisor: "I'll put it this way: I still haven't."
