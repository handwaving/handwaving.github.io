![A comparison of stories. On the left, a satisfying story that has its threads start off untangled, get knotted in the middle, and then are untangled at the end. On the right, an unsatisfying story that has its threads all tangled and knotted, without any resolution.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

The truth though is that the best stories leave me wanting more, with some of the minor threads still a little knotted.
