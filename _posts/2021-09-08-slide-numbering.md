![Left panel: A scientist is on stage with their slides projected. In the bottom-left corner, there's a label that says "0/3". The scientist: "Okay, let's start." A person in the audience, speaking to another audience member: "Oh good, this should be short." Right panel (two hours later): The slide showing says  2/3. An outraged audience member stands up and says, "How are you only at slide 2?! I've counted at least a hundred!" The scientist replies, "Oh, it's just that I'm using a log scale."](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

I'm really looking forward to trying this.
