![Four panels, with title: Distractions for Scientists. Top left: A fancy plot. Top right (An unexpected observation): A researcher on their laptop, holding their chin and saying, "That's weird." Bottom left (Papers online): The site for the arXiv. Bottom right (Free food): First scientist, "Going to the seminar? There's free food." Other scientist, "I'm in."](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

Other distractions: The internet, any stray blackboard with a half-finished calculation, a dinner table with a bunch of other scientists, and a stack full of good fiction books to read.
