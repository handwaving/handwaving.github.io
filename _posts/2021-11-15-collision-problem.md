![A Venn diagram with two circles. The first is the things I like, while the second is the things the people I talk to like. In my circle, I'm asking, "Why don't you like the same things I do?" In the other circle, another person responds, "I could ask the same." The intersection of both circles is a very small sliver, with the label, "Finding this intersection in a conversation is my NP-hard problem."](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }
