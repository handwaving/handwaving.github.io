![A paper with the title "A simple classification of particles", by Martina Laner. The abstract reads, "In this work, we present a new scheme for the known particles. We offer new predictions..." Caption: I love how single authors use the first-person plural.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

Apologies to any scientists named Martina Laner out there!
