![A diagram with two concepts: "Begin a project" and "End a project", with arrows connecting both in an endless cycle. There's a break in the arrow from "End a project" to "Begin a project" which says, "Take a break and celebrate".](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

The highs in science are often short-lived, so make sure to give yourself the time to celebrate. You will have plenty of time to start a new project and be stuck in frustration again!
