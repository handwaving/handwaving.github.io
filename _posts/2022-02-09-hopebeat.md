![A graph showing the "hopebeat" during research. It begins at a baseline, spikes up when we think, "This is a breakthrough!", hits a low when we realize, "Okay, maybe not", bounces back up just above the baseline when we find a new topic to get excited about, spikes when we think, "This will change the world!", crashes down again when we realize it won't work, and then repeats.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

Note: Time between peaks is irregular and can grow to arbitrary durations.
