The first person answers while shrugging, "My physics degree only asserts that *at some point* I knew this."](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

"What, did you expect me to remember that stuff forever?"
