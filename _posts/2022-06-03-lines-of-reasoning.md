![Title is "Lines of Reasoning", and there are nine examples of lines. 1. Circular. 2. Meandering, with the line weaving around the page. 3. Discontinuous, with gaps in the line. 4. Inquisitive, with the line shaped as a looking glass. 5. Logical, with the line shaped like an implication arrow. 6. Confused, with the line shaped as a question mark. 7. Probabilistic, with the line shaped as a binary decision tree. 8. Panicky, with the line darting all over the place. 9. Deep, with the line going down.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }
