![A graph of "Worry" over time. It periodically rises and falls. The worry hits a peak when you think of something that could go wrong, then it lowers as you realize it's fine, then hits a trough when you forget about it, then hits a new peak when you remember that same thing again, and the cycle starts anew.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

Sometimes I tell my brain that I've already worried and gotten over X, but then it finds creative ways to make me worry about X again.
