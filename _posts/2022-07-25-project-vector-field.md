![A one-dimensional vector field. On the left is a point labeled "Start", and on the right is a point labeled "End". The arrows from Start are pointing to the right and getting smaller in magnitude, representing the initial burst of motivation. At a certain point towards End, the arrow direction flips and becomes very large, representing the new difficulty in finishing a project. That point has the label, "Where projects die".](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

The trick is to find enough momentum to carry you through that point.
