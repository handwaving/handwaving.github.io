![The outside of a building with an elevator. As the elevator lift descends, there's a conversation between a scientist and another person. The person says, "So, what do you do as a scientist?" Scientist: "Well, how should I say this for someone without a background..." The elevator descends and the scientist is mumbling, "Uh, it's kind of complicated but..." The person says, "Can you tell me anything?" The elevator gets to the bottom and the scientist says a few things that have been redacted due to jargon, and then says, "And that's what I do."](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }
