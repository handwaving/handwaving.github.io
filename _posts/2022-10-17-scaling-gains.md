![A scientist tells a theorist and a businessperson about their latest work. "I just improved the algorithm's scaling from one polynomial to a slightly smaller one." The theorist replies, "Worth a paper." The businessperson shouts, "I'll give you a milli--wait. I'll get you a paper."](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

Actually, I just listened to a [nice presentation](https://vimeo.com/699425219) by [Jean-Gabriel Young](https://www.jgyoung.ca/) who referred to a N<sup>2</sup> algorithm as "bad". So maybe my focus on theoretical computational complexity is just making me picky...
