![A scientist and his daughter look up in the sky where he is pointing. He says, "It's there." She says, "I don't see anything Dad." He says, "You just need to squint more."

I'm publishing this a day before [Erica Thompson's](http://www.ericathompson.co.uk/) wonderful new book [*Escape from Model Land*](http://www.ericathompson.co.uk/books/). This book is a treasure trove of ideas about the limitations of models and how we should question their foundational assumptions. If you work with models, please check out this book!
