![A scientist is solving a problem for a friend. The scientist says, "Here's the solution to your problem." The friend looks down at the solution and says, "Thanks-wait. What are all these new symbols? Where are my variables?!" The scientist answers, "Oh, they were terrible to work with, so I redefined them to be more natural." Pause.
