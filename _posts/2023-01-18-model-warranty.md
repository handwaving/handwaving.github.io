Right panel: The person says, "Well, the logical reasoning and results are fine, but the assumptions are terrible." The cashier says, "I'm sorry, but our Mathematical Warranty covers everything but the assumptions..."](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

In reality, the person would never return the model, because it gave the results they wanted anyway.
