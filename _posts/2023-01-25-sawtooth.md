![A graph of "Ambition" versus "Time". Ambition starts off high at the beginning of a semester and then linearly decreases until the end of the semester. There's a break where ambition is undefined, and then it begins the cycle anew at the beginning of the next semester.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

Note to self: "Powering through" the breaks results in negative ambition at the beginning of the new semester.
