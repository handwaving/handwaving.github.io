![Two students in the same research group are walking together. One asks, "Ready to present at the journal club today?" The friend says, "Of course." "So you'll share a good paper you've read?" she asks. The friend responds, "Well, I didn't actually *read* it yet, but I'm sure I can present the gist of it from the title!"](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

Pro tip: To make it seem like you've read the whole thing, pick some random sentence deep in the paper and bring it up during your presentation.
