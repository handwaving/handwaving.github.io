![Panel 1 (Find a laptop with a smooth base.): A laptop upside down, with an arrow pointing to the base which says, "Metal preferred". Panel 2 (Load your favourit quantum simulation*.): A researcher at her laptop says, "I'm feeling like some random quantum circuits today." *Must be inefficient classically. Panel 3 (Set N to be about 22.): A Python program with the simulation for 22 qubits. Panel 4 (Wait a few seconds for your laptop to accept its fate. Now, you have a hot plate!): The researcher stands at her desk with a frying pan on top of her laptop and says, "Who knew my research was so applicable?"](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }
