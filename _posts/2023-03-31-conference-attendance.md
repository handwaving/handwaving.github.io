![A graph of "Attendance" versus "Time of day" for a conference. In the morning, there's the start of sessions, followed by a mad rush of people trying to not be too late, leading to a sharp increase in attendance. It stays high for a while until dipping downward due to a lunch exodus, but there's still a contingent of committed attendees who power through. After lunch, attendance picks up again as there are more sessions, only to steadily decline as people are too tired to listen anymore.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

This happens on a macro level too: As I attend more days of a conference, I lose the initial stamina I had to listen to many presentations.
