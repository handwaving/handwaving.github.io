![A person struggles to get out of a deep valley with a rock at the bottom labeled "Expectations". He's saying, "But I don't even want this!"](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

The problem is that I often only notice the valley when it becomes super deep.
