![A person arranges a series of boxes that represent tasks along an axis labeled "Time of day". The axis is almost completely full, and the person is trying to squeeze one last task box that clearly doesn't fit. He's saying, "Why do I feel like I have no time?"](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

"You know, you could give yourself a little space between each task. It's called 'margin'."

"But then I wouldn't be able to fit this task in!"
