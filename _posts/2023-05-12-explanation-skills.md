![A graph of "Explanation complexity" versus "Explanation skills". The curve starts with low complexity and low skills, then both increase as the explainer gets better but over-explains, and finally comes down again as the explainer learns how to use their skills to not make the explanation too complex. In the middle hump though is the region where nobody wants you to explain.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

Have you ever started explaining something, only for the others in your discussion to quickly pivot away from the topic? If so, there's a chance you were in that middle hump. (I've been there too.)
