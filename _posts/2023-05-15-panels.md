![A graph of "Number of panels" versus "Number of allowed figures". It's an inverse relationship. At the point of the curve where there are few allowed figures and many panels, there's an arrow with text that says, "I'm looking at you, Science and Nature!"](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

I'd be curious to have actual data on this.
