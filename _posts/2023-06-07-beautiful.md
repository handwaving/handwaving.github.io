![A mathematician and her friend are talking. Her friend says, "You're always saying math is beautiful. How can I see it too?" The mathematician lifts up a hand and says, "Spend years studying it." She says, "Is there something a little...faster?" The mathematician says, "It's an acquired taste."](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

As [attributed to Euclid](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Euclid): "There is no royal road to geometry."
