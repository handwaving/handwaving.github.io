![Top: A supervisor looks towards their objective, while looking through the obstacles that are blocking the way. He says, "I can see it!" Bottom: Their graduate student looks towards the same objective but cannot see past the obstacles. She says, "It's impossible."](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1535842782/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

Grad student: "But what about all the obstacles?"

Supervisor: "That's what you're here for!"
