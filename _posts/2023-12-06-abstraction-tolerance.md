![A mathematician and her physicist friend are talking. She says, "And now we can generalize--" A machine goes *Beep*! She continues, "--to higher dimensions and --" The machine goes *Beep, beep, beep!* She sighs. "Are abstraction levels even a real health concern you need to monitor?" Her friend says, "With you, yes."](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1697989539/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

My abstraction tolerance is proportional to the number of mathematician friends I have who can patiently explain concepts to me.
