![A timeline of arriving to a meeting. Around 5 minutes before the meeting is when you should arrive for physical meetings. There's an inset graph near the time of the meeting starts, which shows how you enter a virtual meeting only seconds before the meeting time.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1697989539/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

If you arrive more than five seconds before the meeting, there are no established rules of etiquette.
