![A graph of "Number of distinct topics to remember in math" versus "Time". The curve initially goes up as you're learning new topics, but then decreases as you see the connections between topics and only have to memorize a few basic facts.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1697989539/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

I used to hate it when, after either myself or a classmate complained about a lack of memory aids for a test, my mathematics professor would say, "Just rederive anything you don't know! Then you don't have to memorize it." While I think they didn't always appreciate the need for speed during tests, they were definitely on the right track for learning mathematics in general.
