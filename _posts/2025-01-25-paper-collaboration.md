![A graph of "Changes Remaining" versus "Time" for a paper. The curve trends downward until the first draft is completed, and then it periodically spikes back up as collaborators ask for changes. First Collaborator 1, then Collaborator 2, then Collaborator 1 again, and so on. The trend line has the label, "Hope this doesn't asymptotically reach zero".](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1697989539/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }
