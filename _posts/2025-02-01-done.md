![A project timeline from start to end as a line graph. There are dots on the line which represent someone saying, "We're done!" Halfway through the project is the first dot, closely followed by more. Soon, there are a ton of dots all crowding the line, until finally they lower in number again and the final dot actually occurs with reality.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1697989539/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

"We're done!"

(Checks timeline and shakes head)
