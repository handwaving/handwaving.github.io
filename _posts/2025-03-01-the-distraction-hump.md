![A graph of "Desire to distract oneself" versus "Time in focus mode". The curve initially skyrockets, but the desire for distraction then comes down and approaches zero as one stays focused.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1697989539/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

Unfortunately, giving in to a distraction doesn't pause your way through the curve, but resets you back to zero.
