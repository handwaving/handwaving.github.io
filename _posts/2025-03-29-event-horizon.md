![Someone asks their friend, "So, what's next after your PhD?" A thought bubble for the graduate student shows a timeline between now and graduation, with a bunch of question marks after graduation.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1697989539/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

Any other graduate students feeling the same way?
