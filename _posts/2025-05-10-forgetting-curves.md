![A graph of "Memory" versus "Time". The baseline curve (solid line) is just a smooth decay over time. The "Spaced repetition" curve follows the same decay shape, but periodically "resets" the memory to the maximal value and then decays more slowly. "The educator's dream" curve is dot-dashed and never decays.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh3hm8pb7/image/upload/q_auto:best/v1697989539/Handwaving/Published/{{ page.imagelink }}.png){: .centre-image }

As a sports coach, I'm *very* familiar with that baseline.
